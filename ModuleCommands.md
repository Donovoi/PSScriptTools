# Module Commands

This section contains the same help content you would get from a PowerShell prompt using `Get-Help`. Note that code examples have been formatted to fit the 80 character page width. Don't assume you can run examples exactly as they are shown. Some of the help examples use special or custom characters which might not render properly in the PDF.

Remember, you can also view the online help for each command:

```powershell
Help Convertto-WPFGrid -online
```

If you can't remember what commands are in this module, you can always ask PowerShell.

```powershell
Get-Command -module PSScriptTools
```

Or use `Get-PSScriptTools`.
