# Introduction

This manual is a PDF version of a number of reference files as well as the command help. The intention of this manual is to provide a single source for all module documentation. Be aware that many of the source files contain internal cross-references. Best efforts have been made to port those links to this document. External links should work as expected.

If you need to ask a question or report a problem, please visit the module's [Github repository](https://github.com/jdhitsolutions/PSScriptTools).
